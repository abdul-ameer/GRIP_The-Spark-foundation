## Task 1- Improve Lindedlin profile

## Task 2 - To Explore Supervised Machine Learning

<p> In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.¶

Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a
day? <p>
